-- Goals --

This project is a window with buttons to customize 3 different styles of Men's
shirts. The future goals would be to add pants, as well as women's clothing,
including dresses.

This particular implementation/demo is of the modal window that would appear
on the website if a user chooses to customize a particular design from the
"browse" page. This window would save the changes to the browse page on close,
where the user can choose to purchase.
